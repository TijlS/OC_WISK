# OC Mathematics

This is a python project for my OC in mathematics from 2023-2024.

It is about the correlation between points on a circle and the amount of figures you can draw from it.

> [!NOTE]
> Python 3.9 or higher is required

## Dependencies
- matplotlib
- numpy
- itertools
- Tkinter

> Itertools and Tkinter should already be installed when you got Python

They can be installed with:
`
pip install matplotlib numpy
`

## Run the program
Just run `python main.py` in a console

## Issues
If you encounter any issues, please report them.
